<summary> About me ðŸ’»</summary>
<p>First and Foremost I love Coding.I just entered the community and I was amused to see tons of people working and making great things , this inspired me to work and code for the betterment of the community as well as the society and I am definitely  enjoying it.

Ever since writing my first program in C , I have never have had a feeling of getting bored, the only thing I have is the curiosity for something more.
I learned Python and fell in love with it , and started exploring python web frameworks, Machine learning with Python and also bit of tools for data visualization.The potential of Python amused me.I still think it might take a lot time for implementation of python as it is used for many things.

Meanwhile I discovered some new technologies like Java,PHP,SQL which were also good.
I am still pursing my education and would love to know new things all the way from anywhere.
